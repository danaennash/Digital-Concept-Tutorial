**Purpose:** *Explains basic concepts and terms of Digital Images & it's elements*

**Target Audience:** *For my prospective graphic designers and whomever is looking to learn*

## What is a digital image?

*A **digital image** is a numeric representation, normally binary, of a two-dimensional image. 
   * Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. 
   * By itself, the term “digital image” usually refers to raster images or bitmapped images (as opposed to vector images).

### Image Compression

**Image Compression** is a type of data compression applied to digital images, to reduce their cost for storage or transmission.

### Lossy vs Lossless Compression
Lossy | Lossless
---|---
JPEGs and GIFs | RAW, BMP, GIF, and PNG
data from the original file (JPEG) is lost. | image is reduced without any quality loss.
Very small file sizes and lots of tools, plugins, and software support it. | Larger files than if you were to use lossy compression.

#### Example of Lossy vs Lossless Compression

### Bitmap vs Vector Graphics
Bitmap | Vector Graphics
---|---
stored as a series of tiny dots called pixels. | the circle is defined as a shape and is represented by a mathematical construct.
PNG, JPEG, and GIF | SVG
When scaled (zoomed in), the pixels are made bigger so it looks blocky. | When scaled, the mathematical construct of the shape is used to draw it at that size and it is not blocky.

### Other Elements to Know

Term | Definition
---|---
**Color Space** | a specific organization of colors.
**Color Depth** | the number of bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel, in a bitmapped image or video framebuffer, or the number of bits used for each color component of a single pixel
**Indexed Color** | a technique to manage digital images' colors in a limited fashion, in order to save computer memory and file storage, while speeding up display refresh and file transfers. It is a form of vector quantization compression.
**High Color** | a method of storing image information in a computer's memory such that each pixel is represented by two bytes.
